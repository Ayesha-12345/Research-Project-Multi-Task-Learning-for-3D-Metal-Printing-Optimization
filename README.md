## Research Objective

The objective of this research project is to develop a deep learning-based approach for optimizing the SLM process parameters and predicting melt pool dimensions in 3D metal printing. The research objectives include:

1. Developing classification models for building strategy identification.
2. Designing regression models for melt pool dimension prediction.
3. Exploring advanced deep learning architectures and techniques.

Through these objectives, we aim to leverage deep learning to optimize the SLM process and enhance the accuracy of predicting melt pool dimensions. This research will contribute to the advancement of additive manufacturing, enabling the production of defect-free 3D printed metal parts with improved efficiency and reliability.
