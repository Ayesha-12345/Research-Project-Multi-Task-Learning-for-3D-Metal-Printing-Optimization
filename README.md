## Dataset

The raw dataset is borrowed from IISC Bangalore and consists of 66 large micrographs of melt-pool (steel 316 L). The images are recorded on different hatch rotations and magnifications. The dataset includes micro-structural images taken along two different build directions.

### Details of the Raw Dataset

| **Dimensions**         | 2560x1920                |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **BD Normal Images**   | 33                       |
| **BD Parallel Images** | 33                       |
| **Scale**              | 100 µm and 200 µm        |
| **Color mode**         | RGB                      |

## Research Objective

The objective of this research project is to develop a deep learning-based approach for optimizing the SLM process parameters and predicting melt pool dimensions in 3D metal printing.

### Objectives

1. Develop classification models for building strategy identification.
2. Design regression models for melt pool dimension prediction.
3. Explore advanced deep learning architectures and techniques.

## Tasks Completed

### Classification Task

- Implemented a classification model for building strategy identification.
- Explored various activation functions and optimizers to enhance model performance.

### Regression Task

- Designed regression models for predicting melt pool dimensions.
- Investigated the impact of different hyperparameters on the regression task.
